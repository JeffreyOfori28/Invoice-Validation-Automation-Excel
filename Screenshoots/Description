The Sales data is the raw data used for the project; it includes manufacturer names, product names, sales costs, etc. 
It can be used to test Excel automation by uploading new data into the sales profit or other columns to see how it reflects in the other workflow sheets.

The Invoice Sheet was created by importing the sales, manufacturers, product name, invoice id, order date, profit, quantity of orders, and price.
I renamed the sales to revenue for easy identification for the calculation of new columns.
I feature engineered the percentage profit column using the revenue and profit columns with basic Excel formulas.
The status is generated using the if function to approve a margin equal to or less than 50%, and unapproved others above 50%

The macro button Import & Update Invoice can be used to run the automation

The Pivot table shows the average prices, quantity of orders and percentage of profit for the approved orders only.
The Vendor Master data is generated from the pivot table, and it is all linked to the automation.
